"The Lion King" is one of my favorite Disney animated films, so I was nervous about seeing Jon Favreau's remake. Surprisingly, from beginning to end, I found myself consistently enjoying this remake more than the original, and I had no problem with it. This remake absorbed my attention with it's dazzling visuals. This is the only Disney lifelike remake that has no humans, and animals are my passion. How on earth did Jon Favreau and company do it? Let me explain: We all knew it has the same beloved story in beats, but you are wondering how will Favreau's filmmaking techniques execute the story differently. It's like retelling your favorite story by the distinctive style of a different person, and I didn't expect much at all with astonishing results. Jon Favreau displays his best direction here in terms of meticulous timing and cadence. Not to mention that he showcased that the movie's heart is in the perfect place, because of how well he handled the tone. The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson grabbed my attention with the dynamic movements of the camera, and speaking of "camera," the gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is always wonderful with nicely illustrated imagery. "The Lion King" is not only a stunning marvel, but also a well-wrought spectacle because of how strikingly choreographed and vividly-realized it is. The filmmakers have high reverence by embracing everything that made the original so special, and amplified this remake with realism, more exposition, skillful filmmaking, and profound depth to it's themes and to the beloved characters. The conservative themes here feel more reactionary than the original; it is injected with military implications and some political dialogue. The effects team brought this movie to life with virtual reality tools, teaming with "Unity" to create photorealistic backgrounds with tangible details, and they've made the animals incredibly realistic with animalistic precision. I was also very entertained by the fact that the filmmakers accepted the authentic animal behaviors with body language and no facial expressions, because most animals including big cats don't emote through facial expressions. The filmmakers cut out the anteaters, and used aardvarks and other African animals that most families never knew before. The way Hans Zimmer recomposed the stirring score is fantastic with more melodic notes, as well as different melodic themes, and more instruments. The new song "Spirit" is a brilliant fit for the film. The entire star-studded cast is pitch-perfect for their characters with effective delivery. And I must add that with gestures and voice-acting, the interactions between these creature characters are palpable. JD McCrary (young) and Donald Glover (adult) are emotionally involving as Simba. Beyonce as Nala is incredibly fitting. Alfre Woodard has fierce authority for voicing Sarabi. John Oliver is so amusing as the energetic Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa here are a hilarious, silly gay couple; Billy Eichner is snarky as Timon, while Seth Rogan uses his hysterical energy as Pumbaa. James Earl Jones returns as Mufasa; sounding wise, warm, and ancient yet capable of using booming authority. Chewitel Ejiofer is dramatically haunting as the menacing Scar. Scar is portrayed differently here as a brooding and manipulative dictator of wrath, greed, and even lust. And lets not forget that the hyenas are dangerously realistic. Highly Recommended (suitable for ages 8 and up).
